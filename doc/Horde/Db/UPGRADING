This lists the API changes between releases of the package.


Upgrading to 2.1.0
==================

  - Horde_Db_Adapter_Base

    - The execute() and select() methods are abstract now. If you implement a
      custom Horde_Db driver, make sure to have those methods defined.

    - The execute() method has been deprecated and will be removed in Horde_Db
      3.0.0. Use the select() method instead or one of the other query methods.
