This lists the API changes between releases of the package.


Upgrading to 2.1.0
==================

  - Horde_Db_Adapter_Base

    - The execute(), select(), insert(), beginDbTransaction(),
      commitDbTransaction(), and rollbackDbTransaction() methods are abstract
      now.

    - The execute() method has been deprecated for external usage. Use the
      select() method instead or one of the other query methods.

    - The select() method always returns a Horde_Db_Adapter_Base_Result
      sub-class now.
