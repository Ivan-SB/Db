- port Rdo to run on Horde_Db

- document running the test suite

- port updates in schema_definitions.rb and schema_statements.rb

- allow adding multiple indexes (and columns) at once, in an aggregate
  operation. at the abstract level this will just execute the changes one at a
  time; for databases like mysql that can run multiple changes at once, it will,
  achieving much better efficiency.

- replace backend-specific structuredump with a YAML/JSON dump of schema and
  data, including a corresponding importer. should look at what it would take to
  support MDB2_Schema XML instead, and at what Doctrine does, but a simple
  YAML/JSON structure that represents the PHP objects (TableDefinition,
  ColumnDefinition, IndexDefinition) would make it easiest to reconstruct
  identical tables between multiple machines and multiple database types, and a
  simple JSON encoding of data (a single header row, followed by one JSON array
  per database row per line) would take care of most special characters and
  serialization issues, and allow for fast line-by-line reading.

- Handle Horde_Date objects in both input/output from Horde_Db.

- write a make task to generate .sql scripts (for a specific db backend) from
  the schema/data files. might want to automatically generate these for release
  tarballs too.

- migrations. either rails-style, or MDB2 diff between one parsed structure and
  another, or both.

- rdo: add the ability to load a table once, then use it repeatedly in a
  relationship (or to have it be a static array), instead of joining.

- port any updates to mysql adapter

- port any updates to pgsql adapter

- composite primary key support: http://compositekeys.rubyforge.org/

- port disable_referential_integrity?

- port query_cache.rb

- what to do about '0000-00-00' with PostgreSQL?
